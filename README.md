Pushswap
--------------------------------------
### This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

Commands are compressed by storing the commands as a string in a buffer instead of immediately outputting them to the standard output or by storing them in a linked list, etc. command unit.

- For example, the command ra -> rb / rb -> ra can be compressed to rr.
- Also, the command rra -> rrb / rrb -> rra can be compressed with rrr.
- Commands executed in the order of rr -> rrr / rrr -> rr are unnecessary and can be deleted.
- Also, pa -> pb / pb -> pa / ra -> rra / rb -> rrb / sa -> sa / sb -> sb , but the same pair of commands can be deleted.
