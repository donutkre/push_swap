Pushswap
--------------------------------------
### Using stack a and stack , sort the b numbers entered as arguments on the stack a in ascending order.

These are the functions that need to be implemented to run the program.
- sa: swap a - Swaps a the top two elements (Does nothing when there are no elements or only one element.)
- sb: swap b - Swaps b the top two elements (Does nothing when there are no elements or only one element.)
- ss: Performs sa and sb at the same time.
- pa: push a - puts the top b element of a - on a top of . ( b Do nothing when is empty.)
- pb: push b - puts the top a element of b - on b top of . ( a Do nothing when is empty.)
- ra: rotate a - a moves all elements of a - up by one. The first element becomes the last element.
- rb: rotate b - b moves all elements of b - up by one. The first element becomes the last element.
- rr: Performs ra and rb at the same time.
- rra: reverse rotate a - a moves all elements of a down by 1. The last element becomes the first element.
- rrb: reverse rotate b - b moves all elements of b down by 1. The last element becomes the first element.
- rrr: Performs rra and rrb at the same time.
